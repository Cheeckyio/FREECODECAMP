Adding decorative elements: You can use ::after to add decorative elements like borders, backgrounds, or icons to the end of an element.
Creating custom markers: You can create custom markers or bullets for lists or other elements.
Generating content dynamically: You can use ::after to generate content dynamically based on specific conditions or calculations.*/
